### INSTRUCTIONS ###
# Setting up and using the web site:
The first thing that you need to do is open this directory inside Visual Studio Code, and download the Live Server extension if it is not already added using the Extensions tab on the left. Once the extension is added, you will have to click "Go live" on the bottom left, which will then display a port number. Using this port number, you can check the website that we have set up for yourself using the link as "http://localhost:port-number/". In this directory view, you can select which part to you want to move further. This is an important step for each functionality to work as intended. Make sure that you use Chrome as your browser while testing the project.
